# 🔐 Pwpush Terraform Provider

A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) provider to manage secure one-time secret pushes using [Password Pusher](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher) via its REST API.

It supports provisioning of pushes with text, URLs, QR codes, or attached files, including optional expirations, passphrases, and notes.

## 💼 Use Cases

Here are practical scenarios where using the `pwpush` Terraform provider is ideal compared to manual usage:

- ✅ **GitOps & automation**: Push secrets in CI/CD pipelines as part of automated infrastructure provisioning.
- 🔐 **Temporary credential sharing**: Safely share credentials with newly created users, contractors, or services.
- 🛠️ **Immutable environments**: Recreate secrets on every Terraform run as part of a secure, reproducible workflow.
- 📤 **Credential delivery**: Deliver generated passwords (e.g., via Terraform random provider) to human recipients.
- 🚫 **Avoid storing secrets in state files**: Send secrets via expiring link instead of embedding in outputs or storage.
- 🧪 **Secret testing environments**: Create disposable, time-limited secrets for test or staging use.
- 🧾 **Auditable provisioning**: Keep track of when secrets are pushed and for what purpose via version control.
- 📦 **Multi-platform provisioning**: Coordinate secret delivery alongside cloud or on-prem resource provisioning.

This provider makes it easy to integrate secure secret sharing into infrastructure-as-code workflows, especially where automation and reproducibility are key.
